# QTH-Locator
The purpose of the application is to display a [QTH Locator (Maidenhead Locator System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System) useful for amateur radio operators. Data on the application screen refreshes automatically, so you can use it while on the move.

The app was built for the Apple Watch with a companion app on the iPhone.
